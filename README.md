### Interests
* Web development (Vue.js and JavaScript)
* Mobile development (Flutter and Dart)
* Browsing Reddit on my free time :)

### Technical Background 
I primarily dig into web and mobile development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, and Flutter. However, I also have working experience in Java and Golang. I'm a Software Developer Intern at Service Express primarily working with SQL and miscellanous web development work. Front-end development is my favorite, but I am knowledgeable in the back-end as well with Node.js and Go. I am a junior at Grand Valley!
